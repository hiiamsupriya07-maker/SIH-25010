## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

â€¢ A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
â€¢ Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
â€¢ Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
â€¢ Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
â€¢ Market price tracking.
â€¢ Voice support for low-literate users.
â€¢ Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

â€¢ Small and marginal farmers
â€¢ Agricultural extension officers
â€¢ Government agriculture departments
â€¢ NGOs and cooperatives
â€¢ Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

â€¢ 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
â€¢ Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20â€“30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a **mobile-first, AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System** designed specifically for **small and marginal farmers**. It provides personalized, location- and crop-specific guidance on farming activities such as irrigation, fertilization, pest/disease management, and weather-based alerts. Farmers can receive real-time advisories through a **multilingual and voice-enabled app**, even with low internet connectivity. The system leverages weather APIs, soil data, and AI models (including image-based pest detection) to deliver accurate, timely, and actionable recommendations. It aims to improve crop yield, reduce input costs, and make precision farming accessible and affordable for rural farmers.
## Technical Approach

The system will be developed as a **cross-platform mobile application** using **Flutter**, backed by a **Python (FastAPI) backend**. Farmer data (location, crop, soil) will be stored in a **PostgreSQL database**. Real-time weather data will be fetched from APIs like **OpenWeatherMap**, while **AI/ML models** (built using TensorFlow or PyTorch) will analyze crop images for pest/disease detection. A rule-based engine will generate crop-stage advisories and fertilizer schedules. Notifications and alerts will be sent via **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** and **SMS gateway**. The app will support **offline mode**, **multilingual UI**, and **voice input/output** for accessibility in rural areas.

* **Technical Feasibility**: The solution uses existing, proven technologiesâ€”mobile development frameworks (like Flutter), weather APIs, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML models for image recognitionâ€”making development practical with current tools and datasets.
* **Data Availability**: Weather forecasts, soil health data, satellite imagery (like NDVI), and pest/crop information are publicly accessible through APIs and government portals (e.g., IMD, ISRO, ICAR).
* **User Accessibility**: The app is designed for low-bandwidth, rural areas with multilingual and voice support, making it suitable for small and marginal farmers with low digital literacy.
* **Team Capability**: With a skilled team in app development, data science, and agriculture domain knowledge, the project can be built within a few months as an MVP.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Viability**

* **Market Need**: Over 85% of Indiaâ€™s farmers are small and marginal. Most lack access to timely expert adviceâ€”this system directly addresses a critical pain point.
* **Scalability**: The platform can be scaled to different regions and crops by updating data layers and advisory rules. APIs and microservices architecture ensure modularity.
* **Affordability**: As a mobile-based advisory tool with offline features and low operational cost, it is economically viable for both farmers and implementing agencies.
* **Government & NGO Support**: There is strong institutional interest in digital agri-advisory systems (e.g., Digital India, PM-KISAN), making it fundable and partner-friendly.
* **Long-Term Impact**: Improved yield, reduced crop losses, optimized input use, and increased farmer income make this solution sustainable and socially impactful.

In summary, the solution is both **technically feasible** and **economically viable**, with strong potential for **scalability and real-world adoption**.
